## getting started

to use the adapter, you will need a sun workstation, as well as a usb keyboard and/or mouse.

you will also need an 8-pin mini-din cable, male to male, **with each pin connected to the same pin on the other end**. we recommend the original sun cable (530-1442 or 530-1442-02) or the [lindy 31532](https://www.lindy.com.au/serial-cable-8-pin-mini-din-m-m-2m), but they are sometimes sold as a “mini-din serial cable”, LocalTalk cable, or AppleTalk cable.

|  |  |
|-|-|
| ⚠️<br>**watch out!** | do not use mini-din cables with any pins swapped, like the apple 590-0552-A. if you are unsure, check with a multimeter in continuity mode. |
| | be sure to hold the mini-din port on the adapter while connecting or disconnecting a cable. the port can be tight, so holding it will minimise strain on the board. |

connect the adapter to your sun workstation with the mini-din cable, and connect any keyboards and mice to the usb-a ports on the adapter. the usb-c port on the adapter (rev A2+) is for debugging and firmware updates only.

## the power key

some sun keyboards have a power key, which switches on the workstation by toggling pin 7 of the mini-din port, in addition to sending scancodes like other keys.

to switch on your workstation, press the onboard power button (rev A1+), or press **Right Ctrl+P** on your usb keyboard. note that the latter will only work if the adapter is powered externally via the usb-c port (rev A2+) or the VBUS pin of the debug header.

to send the power key to software while the workstation is on, press **Right Ctrl+P** on your usb keyboard. the onboard power button (rev A1+) does not send any scancodes.

## the display

![display](images/display.png)

| off | on | meaning |
|-|-|-|
| ![](images/display-clk.png) | ![](images/display-clk-on.png) | **click mode** — as set by the workstation, ignoring the “force click” setting |
| ![](images/display-bel.png) | ![](images/display-bel-on.png) | **bell active** |
| ![](images/display-cap.png) | ![](images/display-cap-on.png) | **caps lock active** |
| ![](images/display-cmp.png) | ![](images/display-cmp-on.png) | **compose active** |
| ![](images/display-scr.png) | ![](images/display-scr-on.png) | **scroll lock active** |
| ![](images/display-num.png) | ![](images/display-num-on.png) | **num lock active** |
| ![](images/display-buzzer-off.png) | ![](images/display-buzzer-on.png) | **buzzer active** — making any sound, including click, bell, or plug or unplug notifications |

## the settings menu

usb3sun remembers its settings while powered off (firmware 1.2+).

to open the settings menu, press **Right Ctrl+Space**. use the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to select a setting, then use **Left** and **Right** to change settings listed as “in place”, or **Return** or **Enter** to choose other actions.

| setting | firmware | in place? | values |
|-|-|-|-|
| Go back | 1.0+ | no | closes the settings menu |
| Force click | 1.2+ | yes | **no** = allow the workstation to control the click mode |
|  |  |  | **off** = never click when pressing keys |
|  |  |  | **on** = always click when pressing keys |
| Click duration | 1.0+ | yes | 0 ms, 5 ms, 10 ms, …, 100 ms |
| Hostid | 1.5+ | no | sets the hostid used when reprogramming your idprom |
| Reprogram idprom | 1.5+ | no | plays a macro that reprograms your idprom |
| Wipe idprom (AAh) | 1.5+ | no | plays a macro that makes your idprom contents invalid |

\* aka Super, Mod4, Windows, etc

The alternate binding for `Stop` to the `End` key is provided so that
the `Stop-a` chord can be pressed to enter the boot monitor on
SPARCstations.

## updating the firmware

you can update or reflash the firmware over usb (rev A2+), or with a picoprobe.

### usb method

1. press and hold the BOOTSEL button underneath the adapter
2. connect the adapter’s usb-c port to your computer
3. release the BOOTSEL button
4. copy firmware.uf2 to the usb mass storage device — you can copy it as a file to the FAT file system, or write to the block device directly with dd(1)

### picoprobe method

you will need a [raspberry pi pico](https://www.altronics.com.au/p/z6421a-raspberry-pi-pico-rp2040-development-board-with-headers/), other than the one used by usb3sun, which we’ll call the debugger. you will also need a way to connect pins on the adapter’s debug header to pins on the debugger, such as [header pins](https://www.altronics.com.au/p/p5430-oupiin-40-way-header-pin/) and [jumper cables](https://www.altronics.com.au/p/p1023-socket-to-socket-30-way-prototyping-ribbon-strips/).

flash the debugger with [the picoprobe firmware](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe), then connect the adapter to the debugger as follows, being sure to connect GND first and disconnect GND last.

| rev A0 | rev A1, A2, A3 | picoprobe |
|-|-|-|
| GND | GND | GND (pin 8) |
|  | UART_TX | GP5 (pin 7) |
|  | UART_RX | GP4 (pin 6) |
| SWDIO | SWDIO | GP3 (pin 5) |
| SWCLK | SWCLK | GP2 (pin 4) |
| VBUS | VBUS | VBUS (pin 40) |

to flash the adapter with firmware.elf, run the command below.

```
$ openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg -c 'adapter speed 1000' -c 'program firmware.elf verify reset exit'
```
